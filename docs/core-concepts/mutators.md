# Mutators

**Mutators** are Javascript functions, defined by the developer, that define logic to transform the shared application state. A key feature of mutators is that *they run twice*:
  - Mutators are first run on the client against the client's local state, and the client's user interface updates almost immediately. The mutation does not wait for a server response. This is intentional, and is also vital in keeping the client's perceived response times low and the user experience smooth. Because these mutators have not yet been confirmed by the authoritative server, the mutations made by this first run of mutators are known as optimistic mutations.Â 

  - Mutators are then run by the server against the server's state, which is the authoritative state. Although the defined mutators are the same, because the mutators are now run against the server's state instead of the client's state, the result of the mutation may be different. This occurrence is a normal part of the syncing process. When the server broadcasts its authoritative updates and if the client state with applied optimistic mutations is different than the authoritative state sent by the server, Syncosaurus will automatically roll back its applied optimistic mutations and apply updates to match the server's authoritative state.

Because mutators are just high-level Javascript functions, the developer gains a high level of flexibility and control in how and when updates should be mutated. Mutators can be used to not only modify the shared state of a collaborative application. These mutators can also be used to selectively aggregate, merge, and delete different pieces of the shared state, as well as to implement custom application logic or fine-grained authorization.
